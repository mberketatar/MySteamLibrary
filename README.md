# MySteamLibrary
This project is to analyse my Steam library and my game preferences. It was done as a project for CS210 class.
It includes a Python notebook which is the main report and the static pdf version of the said notebook. It also has the static html of the Steam page and the csv files that might be necessary during the running of the notebook.
